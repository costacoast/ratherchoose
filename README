This is the home of the ratherchoose.com website project where I'm creating a 'what would you rather choose' site for my wacky friends to share some of their most gut-wrenching ultimatums with the world. 

At this point the site consists mostly of the slightly modified twitter bootstrap HTML/LESS framework and is my first experimentation with LESS. The plan is to mock the site up in HTML/LESS and then make it dynamic using the ExressionEngine CMS platform so my non-technical friends can log in and keep this beast updated.
